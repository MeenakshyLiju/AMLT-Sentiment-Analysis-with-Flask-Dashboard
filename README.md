This repository contains the code for the ChatGPT Sentiment Analysis and Entity Recognition project, which utilizes machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning (BERT) models to perform sentiment analysis and entity recognition on a dataset of tweets. 
Due to size limitations, the saved models and dataset are not included in this repository. 
You can access the dataset used for this project from Kaggle at the following link: [ChatGPT Sentiment Analysis Dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charunisa/chatgpt-sentiment-analysis/data).

The requirements.txt file contains the dependencies required to run the Flask dashboard, which visualizes model results, including sentiment distributions, entity-specific analysis, and model comparisons.
